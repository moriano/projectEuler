Hello,

projectuler.net contains a number of math problems to be solved by coding.

I think it is a fantastic way to exercise the mind, and also to learn a new programming language as the
algorithms to implement are not too big.

If you are planning on solving problems, I suggest you to solve them on your own, do not just copy someone else
solution's, it is not fun and you will learn nothing.
